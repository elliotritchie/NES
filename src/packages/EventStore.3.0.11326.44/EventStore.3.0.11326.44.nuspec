    <description>The purpose of the EventStore is to represent a series of events as a stream. Furthermore, it provides hooks whereby any events committed to the stream can be dispatched to interested parties.</description>
    <summary>The EventStore is a persistence library used to abstract different storage implementations when using event sourcing as storage mechanism. The primary use is most often associated with CQRS.</summary>
